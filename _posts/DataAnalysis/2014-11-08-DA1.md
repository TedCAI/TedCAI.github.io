### Principles of Analytic Graphics

Principle 1: Show comparisions

Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure

Principle 3: Show multivariate data
- Multivariate = more than 2 variables
- The real world is multivariate
- Need to "escape flatland"

Principle 4: Integrateion of evidence
- Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
- Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
- Don't let the tool drive the analysis

Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.

Principle 6: Content is king
- Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content
