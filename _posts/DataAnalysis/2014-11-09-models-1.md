### Why do we need models?

1. Provide insight into why we see certain phenomena:
- Why do social networks have short average path lengths?
2. Allow for comparative statics:
- How does component structure change with density?
  Important in contagion/diffusion/learning...
3. Predict out of sample:
- What will happen with a new policy (vaccine, R&D subsidy, ...)?
4. Allow for statistical estimation:
- Is there significant clustering on a local level or did it appear at random?

"Social" networks have special characteristics
- small worlds, degree distributions

### Embeddedness of Economic Activity
- Few markets are centralized, anonymous
- Specific relationships matter...

### Other Settings
Networks and social interactions in crime
Networks and Markets
Social Insurance
Diffusion
Sociology literature
