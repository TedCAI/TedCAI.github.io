## Clustering

- What fraction of my friends are friends of each other?

- Cl(i)(g) = #{kj in g | k, j in N(i)(g)} / #{kj | k, j in N(i)(g)}

- Average clustering:

      Clavg(g) = ∑(i)Cl(i)(g) / n

- Overall clustering:

Cl(g) = ∑(i)#{kj in g | k, j in N(i)(g)} / ∑(i)#{kj | k, j in N(i)(g)}

Node 5 has 3 neighbors, 1,2 and 3. So it has 3 pairs of neighbors, 12, 23 and 13, among which only the pair1 and 3 are linked. Thus the clustering of 5 is 1/3.
