### Connectives

A sentense "p and q", it could be represented as p /\ q.

For "p or q", it could be represented as p \/ q.

And if we want to say "if p then q" or "p implies q", we could represent it p → q

Also for "if and only if p then q", it could be p ≡ q

In a sentence, "and" could refer to "and". It also could refer to "and then".

"Unless" is a disjunctions.

Conjunctions->and.
Disjunctions->or, unless.
Conditional statement->only if, if..then..
